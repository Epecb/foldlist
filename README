Overview
--------
This is inspired by the taglist plugin.  The "Fold List" plugin 
provides the following features:
                                                                  
1. Opens a vertically split Vim window with a list of folds in 
   the current file.
2. Moving through the fold list with the j, k, l, h, moves to the
   associated fold in the file.
3. <CR> jumps between file and fold list.

Usage
-----
You can open the foldinst window from a source window by using the ":Flist"
command.
              nnoremap <silent> <F9> :Flist<CR>
                                                                            
Add the above mapping to your ~/.vimrc file.
                                                                            
You can close the taglist window from the taglist window by pressing 'q' or
using the Vim ":q" command.
